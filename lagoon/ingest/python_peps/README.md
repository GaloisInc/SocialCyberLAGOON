# Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

PEP types:
- Standards Track – New feature.
- Process – Like Standards Track, but doesn't directly apply to Python.
- Informational – General guidelines.

We probably want to focus on Standards Track and Process for ML purposes.

PEP statuses:

PEPs may connect to separate repos where the code is developed.

Each PEP has a champion / author. Discussion is done in:
- python-dev@python.org
- python-ideas@python.org

Relevant discussion messages can be found in 2 ways:
- Search the mailing list archives for `PEP xxx`. This returns all messages which have the term `PEP xxx`. Each message in a thread is listed separately, which is great.
- Sometimes the PEP page has a bunch of references to related messages. ([Example for PEP 435](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/#references)). This is a small set of messages which are significant in the lifetime of the PEP. Some of these messages may not explicitly have the words `PEP xxx` and hence will not show up in the previous search. This is why these should be considered separately. When considering these, make sure to get all messages in that thread.
