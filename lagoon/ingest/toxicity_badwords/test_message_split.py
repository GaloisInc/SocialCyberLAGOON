comments down to two questions:

1. For anyone who knows: when the documentation refers to "compatibility
with `.time`", is that just saying it was designed that way because
.time returns a float (i.e. for /consistency/ with `.time()`), or is
there some practical reason that you would want `.time()` and
`.mktime()` to return the same type?

2. Mainly for Victor, but anyone can answer: I agree that the natural
output of `mktime()` would be `int` if I were designing it today, but
would there be any /practical/ benefits for making this change? Are
there problems cropping up because it's returning a float? Is it faster
to return an integer?

Best,

Paul

But all Python times are reported or accept floats -- this allows
sub-second precision without using complicated data structures. None of the
C functions use floats. Consistency with C should not be the issue --
consistency between the time functions is important.

So let's drop the idea.

In C, the signature of mktime is time_t mktime(struct tm *time);
from Wikipedia, the Unix time_t data type, on many platforms, is a
signed integer, tradionally (32bits). In the newer operating systems,
time_t has been widened to 64 bits.

Antoine only mentioned 'repr' as being an abbreviation for
'representation', just as 'qualname' will be an abbreviation for
'qualified name'.

The "less ambiguous repr()" use case is just one minor aspect of the
new qualified names, even if it's the most immediately visible, so
using 'repr' in the attribute name would give people all sorts of
wrong ideas about the scope of its utility.

Cheers,
Nick.
