# Machine Learning for Social Cyber

Most of the folders here correspond to different experiments. Running some of these experiments requires cloning the [`lagoon-artifacts` repository](https://gitlab-ext.galois.com/lagoon/lagoon-artifacts) as a sibling to this repository. Input data for the experiments and output results produced from running them are stored in `lagoon-artifacts`.

## Other Guild-based experiments

Run as e.g.:

```sh
$ guild run gcn_true_202108_v1 [-e to see flags]
```

## Data Findings
- Earliest and latest times in the whole `cpython` repo = `(datetime.datetime(1990, 8, 9, 14, 25, 15), datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 28, 22, 2, 18))`.
- Earliest and latest times in the whole OCEAN dataset = `(datetime.datetime(1995, 3, 16, 6, 8, 16), datetime.datetime(2021, 5, 1, 3, 7, 50))`.
