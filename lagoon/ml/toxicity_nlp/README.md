# Analysis of NLP toxicity features
The toxicity features obtained from running the NLP models in `lagoon/ml/nlp_models` are added to the DB via `lagoon/ingest/toxicity_nlp/`. This folder contains scripts to analyze this data, such as its comparison to the toxicity badwords data.

This folder does not include other experiments performed using the toxicity NLP features, such as Have I Been Pwned. Those are in separate folders.
